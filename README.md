## What are Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development
There are many pros and cons of Test driven development (TDD).

TDD improves code quality by writing tests that define the desired behaviour of the code. This leads to better code quality because it forces developers to think about the functionality and design of their code before writing it. Tests can also serve as a form of documentation and specification. They describe how the code should behave, making it easier for other developers to understand and use the code. Additionally, it helps with maintaining code stability. Once tests are in place, they can be re-run at any time to check if new changes have introduced unintended side effects. Lastly, TDD can help catch and fix bugs and issues early in the development process. When a test fails, it signals that something is wrong, allowing you to address the problem immediately. 

TDD introduces more overhead as maintaining tests will take more development time and effort. Tests need to be updated when the expected functionality of the code changes and this can be exceptionally time consuming in larger codebases. Furthermore, TDD primarily focuses on unit testing, thus it may not be good enough for end-to-end testing. Finally, depending solely on TDD may result in missing some requirements or use cases that aren't captured in the initial set of tests.
